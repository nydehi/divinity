Divinity Community Edition remade

My goals are a quite a few. The biggest issue in Run UO is the code naturally reflects the era in which it was originally written -c# 2!

* Bring some sanity to the source code
* Utilize modern concepts - IOC,composition e.g.MEF 
* Use modern C# constructs. 
* unit tests
* Redis to save and hold data. Superfast.

I find that the origanization modeled on the original code base is not well suited to .NET,

Now for the whys.

* I want to implement AI for the NPCs.
* I want to implement the original natural spawn system. The problem was players were killing all the animals. well it was the result of an unnatural and unrealistic aspect of game play that allow players everywhere animals were allowed.  In the real world mountains and forests can be densed where people cannot move through but animals can. but even then of course sometime arrows can be used. The dungeons should have passageways that are too narrow for players but just right for Mobs. 



**Fair Warning**
My coding style and commit habits are probably not yours!! LOL . I have been a professional programmer/developer since 1995. I tend to go for code style that the newbies can read. however dont shy away from using IOC etc. I try to code in the least crazy way without sacrificing  speed of finishing.

I have limited time. So I commit after each session no matter how little was done. I tag only when there is a feature done or something like a milestone was accomplished. Dont for your sanity download a commit that is not a tag. If it is not a tag it is not probably compilable. The idea is no  matter what no work is **ever** lost. 





zlib builds can be found at https://github.com/msturgill/zlib/releases/tag/v1.2.8

This project will not be updated to current RunUO unless there is significant interest. Pull requests are welcome.
